# **FourRooms**

A simple Reinforcement learning project that runs the well known Four Rooms as a test environment

# Scenarios 
    
**Scenario1**
    - reinforcement learning agent that finds one package in the environment

**Scenario2**
    - reinforcement learning agent that fetches 3 packages from a grid environment.

**Scenario3**
    - agent that finds 3 packages from an environment in the order of red, green, blue

# Running

Running each of these programs requires only running the following command in the terminal 

    python3 ScenarioX.py

where X represents the number of the Scenario that you want to run.

the program will then begin to train the agent in the environment wich the specified amount of EPOCHS. the following message will display in the terminal while the agent is training

    Training... numnber of epochs ( X / N )
where N represents the total number of epochs that will be trained and X shows the current epoch that the agent is training within.
